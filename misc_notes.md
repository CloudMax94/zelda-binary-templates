# wareya on original dumps
## ZELOOTMA.z64
* ROM HASH: 8CA71E87DE4CE5E9F6EC916202A623E9 (OOT)
* The OOT Debug ROM is a perfect dump.
* It might have been watermarked, and if it was, the watermark has been removed.
* It's a european-language copy of the game, but it's compiled with NTSC rates, due to being targeted at GC N64 emulation (Master Quest).

## MMDBG.z64
* ROM HASH: 71FBAE5D2B27926EA54E92CE2FC91622 (MM)
* The MM Debug ROM is a perfect dump.
* However, it's a full PAL N64 ROM.
* That said, it doesn't have region protection enabled. 
* Also, some "useless buffer data", which was full of FFFF bytes, was overwritten with release notes.
* This is not part of the ROM data, so it's fine.
